# ASYNC JOKE VOTING API (Chapter 3 & 4)


- path + query + body parameters.
- async endpoints
- simple routing / structure
- basic error handling


****

We're building a tiny backed for a joke website where users can:

- list jokes
- read a single joke
- add new jokes
- delete jokes with condition

All data will stay **in memory** (List/Dict) no DB needed.
